Advanced API ProjectThis project is a Django REST Framework application designed to manage authors and books. It demonstrates advanced features such as custom serializers with nested relationships, generic views for CRUD operations, permissions, and advanced querying capabilities like filtering, searching, and ordering.Setup and InstallationClone the repository and navigate into the advanced-api-project directory.Create and activate a virtual environment:python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:pip install django djangorestframework django-filter
Apply database migrations:python3 manage.py migrate
Create a superuser to test authenticated endpoints:python3 manage.py createsuperuser
Run the development server:python3 manage.py runserver
API EndpointsThe API provides endpoints for managing Authors and Books.Author EndpointsHandled by a ViewSet. Base URL: /api/authors/EndpointHTTP MethodDescriptionPermissions/api/authors/GETList all authorsPublic (Read-only)/api/authors/POSTCreate a new authorAuthenticated Only/api/authors/<int:pk>/GETRetrieve a single authorPublic (Read-only)/api/authors/<int:pk>/PUT / PATCHUpdate an authorAuthenticated Only/api/authors/<int:pk>/DELETEDelete an authorAuthenticated OnlyBook EndpointsHandled by separate generic views.EndpointHTTP MethodDescriptionPermissions/api/books/GETList all booksPublic (Read-only)/api/books/<int:pk>/GETRetrieve a single bookPublic (Read-only)/api/books/create/POSTCreate a new bookAuthenticated Only/api/books/<int:pk>/update/PUT / PATCHUpdate a bookAuthenticated Only/api/books/<int:pk>/delete/DELETEDelete a bookAuthenticated OnlyAdvanced Querying (Book List)The /api/books/ endpoint supports filtering, searching, and ordering.FilteringFilter by publication_year or author (by ID).Example: GET /api/books/?publication_year=1949Example: GET /api/books/?author=1SearchingPerform a case-insensitive search on the title and the author's name.Example: GET /api/books/?search=orwellExample: GET /api/books/?search=farmOrderingOrder by publication_year or title. Prepend a - for descending order.Example: GET /api/books/?ordering=title (A-Z)Example: GET /api/books/?ordering=-publication_year (Newest first)Running TestsThis project includes a comprehensive unit test suite to ensure API integrity. The tests cover CRUD operations, permissions, and advanced querying features.To run the tests, execute the following command from the project root directory:python3 manage.py test api
The test runner will set up a separate, temporary database, run all tests located in the api/tests.py file, and then report the results. This ensures that your development database is not affected by the tests.
