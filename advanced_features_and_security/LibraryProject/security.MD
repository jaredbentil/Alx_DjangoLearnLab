Security Review: The implemented settings secure against a range of vulnerabilities.

HTTPS Enforcement: SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT and HSTS settings ensure all data is encrypted in transit.

Cookie Security: SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE and CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE protect sensitive cookies.

Header Protection: X_FRAME_OPTIONS and SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF defend against clickjacking and MIME-sniffing.

Potential Areas for Improvement:

Content Security Policy (CSP): For more advanced XSS protection, you could implement a CSP to control which resources (scripts, stylesheets, etc.) can be loaded by the browser.

Password Security: You could configure a custom password validator to enforce stronger password policies.
